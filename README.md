For a distinctions project (extra credit) for school, I made a car to train a fish. This car allowed the fish to swim in a fish tank, and the entire fish tank to move in said direction. 
This project took the entire school year to make, coming up with creative ways to solve problems others demed impossible, inventing new forms of data transmission, 
hundreds of hours of CAD'ing and machiening, and so much more. Additionally, I gave two speaches after the project, one in front of my entire school and new admissions students 
and families, and one in front of the new 6th and 7th graders. In addition, I was invited to give a talk at MIT.
